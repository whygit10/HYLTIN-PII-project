# products

This folder contains all the products of this project.

The `manuscript.qmd` file located in the `manuscript` folder contains most of the report, figures, discussion, and information regarding the project.

For the time being, the project is a work in progress, so exploratory and draft work may also be found there until it is finished.

I do not expect to need to supplementary material, but if I do it will go into the `/supplement` folder here. Similarly I do not expect that slides will be necessary, but I may use them for a more streamlined presentation version of the report. If so they will go in the `/slides` folder.
