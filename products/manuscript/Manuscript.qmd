The structure below is one possible setup for a data analysis project (including the course project). For a manuscript, adjust as needed. 
You don't need to have exactly these sections, but the content covering those sections should be addressed.

This uses MS Word as output format. [See here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html) for more information. You can switch to other formats, like html or pdf. See [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) for other formats.

# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis_ 
[Last year](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/austin-named-city-with-15th-biggest-homicide-rate-problem-study), Austin was ranked among the top US cities with a problem in homicide rate. Earlier [this year](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/austin-crime-rate-drops-2024-2020-comparison/269-b62042b7-a6f2-4224-87ff-ede655a37912), the claim was made that crime has dropped to a new low since 2021. The intention of this analysis will be to investigate both claims, and gain a better understanding of Austin's criminal activity. While these claims will be in mind throughout the steps of the analysis, I intend to approach it from more of an exploratory standpoint, so not to only go out and investigate the claims but really any insights that can be gleaned around Austin criminal activity and how it has changed over time.
What the analysis will not cover would be things like *causes* of the changes in crime, at least not directly. I may identify shifts that could inform the cause, but the goal will not be to drill down into every potential socioeconomic factor and pick the primary drivers, instead simply to observe what crime in the city of Austin looks like and what we might be able to expect going forward. Aside from resources outlined in our course resources, I was hoping to also draw from this [book](https://otexts.com/fpp2/index.html). It's not one I have used before but it had been recommended to me previously and I would like to learn more about time series and forecasting in general.

## Description of data and data source
_Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section._
My primary data source will come from [here](https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Reports/fdj4-gpfu/about_data), but I will likely need to pull from other sources as well, potentially finding other cities' crime stats that made the same list of problematic homicide rates, or even Austin's demographic information and statistics like population size.
```{r Load Raw Data}
d1 <- read.csv(here('data','raw-data','raw_crime_060424.csv'))
```

```{r Quick Summaries}
summary(d1)
head(d1)
```
The data has several data and time fields, many of which are character strings meaning they will need to be cleaned/recoded. The rest of the fields are mostly classification variables and location information, but with 2,470,867 there is quite a bit of opportunity for frequency and classification analysis.

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
_State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis._
Ultimately, I would like to explore a few questions: 
  1. Has crime truly dropped, or is it expected to rise again as the year progresses? 
  2. Has the homicide rate dropped with crime? 
  3. Has the homicide rate been a problem for long time, or was it truly an emerging problem last year?
  
  

To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a].

# Methods 

_Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement._


## Schematic of workflow

Sometimes you might want to show a schematic diagram/figure that was not created with code (if you can do it with code, do it). @fig-schematic is an example of some - completely random/unrelated - schematic that was generated with Biorender.
We store those figures in the `assets` folder.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic
#| fig-cap: "A figure that is manually generated and shows some overview/schematic. This has nothing to do with the data, it's just a random one from one of our projects I found and placed here."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("assets","antigen-recognition.png"))
```




## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._


## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Statistical analysis
_Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. I generally recommend the `here` package.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```



## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like.
